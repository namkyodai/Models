  Abstract                 = {A supply and demand system approach is presented to deal with the inability of existing bridge management systems to determine optimal management strategies when multiple bridges may be adversely affected simultaneously. The supply and demand system approach alleviates this limitation because the optimization problem is formulated to minimize overall costs on the transportation network. The optimization problem is formulated focusing on the ability of the transportation network as a whole ~system! to provide an adequate level of service, taking into consideration the role and performance of the bridges in the network ~supply! and the consequences if an adequate level of service is not provided ~demand!. The supply and demand system approach is illustrated by determining the optimal management strategies for five bridges in a real transportation network subjected to two hazard scenarios: overloading due to traffic and scouring due to flooding. The main conclusion is that the supply and demand system approach is a rational approach to the development of optimal management strategies when bridges are adversely affected and may become nonoperational simultaneously.},

  Abstract                 = {In Switzerland, it is common practice to estimate the total benefits of new roads before they have been built and of road <i>improvement interventions</i> before they have been performed. The guidelines with respect to standardised methodologies and models to be used have been developed (VSS 2003a) and are now in use. It is not yet, however, common practice to estimate the total benefits of road <i>preservation interventions</i> and hence guidelines do not exist with respect to standardised methodologies and models to be used. In order to provide this information, the research package VSS 2004/710-716 was started. This paper presents the methodology and models proposed to be used to evaluate the total benefits of road preservation interventions in Switzerland based on the evaluation and synthesis of existing national and international literature on the relationships between pavement condition and benefits of road use conducted in project 714 of the research package. The use of the methodology and models are demonstrated by determining the optimal intervention strategy for a representative situation in Switzerland. The impact on the optimal intervention strategy of the consideration of multiple stakeholders is investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {Before an optimal bridge management strategy can be determined in existing bridge management systems, there must first be a determination of the type and schedule of interventions to be performed on each element of the bridge to achieve a minimal-cost long-term steady state. Once these element-level strategies are known, they are grouped together, or bundled, to develop a management strategy for the bridge. This is currently done with a set of agency rules without regard to whether the bundle of interventions is optimal. Interventions are bundled because it is not desirable to perform interventions on the same bridge in successive years, principally because of user costs. The work discussed here uses inventory theory to bundle interventions on bridges optimally with multiple elements. Two examples are presented. Example 1 shows how a basic joint replenishment model can be used on a multielement bridge to determine optimal management strategies when interventions are bundled and a single-stage policy is used. Example 2 shows how a joint replenishment model with quantity discounts can be used to alleviate some of the problems with a basic joint replenishment model. The optimal management strategy determined in Example 2 is compared with the optimal management strategy determined when interventions are not bundled. Direction for future work is given.},

The paper discusses how the \{TBM\} and \{CBM\} techniques work toward maintenance decision making. Recent research articles covering the application of each technique are reviewed. The paper then compares the challenges of implementing each technique from a practical point of view, focusing on the issues of required data determination and collection, data analysis/modelling, and decision making. The paper concludes with significant considerations for future research. Each of the techniques was found to have unique concepts/principles, procedures, and challenges for real industrial practise. It can be concluded that the application of the \{CBM\} technique is more realistic, and thus more worthwhile to apply, than the \{TBM\} one. However, further research on \{CBM\} must be carried out in order to make it more realistic for making maintenance decisions. The paper provides useful information regarding the application of the \{TBM\} and \{CBM\} techniques in maintenance decision making and explores the challenges in implementing each technique from a practical perspective. },

  Abstract                 = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. },

  Abstract                 = {Considerable benefits have been gained from using Markov decision processes to select condition-based maintenance policies for the asset management of infrastructure systems. A key part of the method is using a Markov process to model the deterioration of condition. However, the Markov model assumes constant transition probabilities irrespective of how long an item has been in a state. The semi-Markov model relaxes this assumption. This paper describes how to fit a semi-Markov model to observed condition data and the results achieved on two data sets. Good results were obtained even where there was only 1 year of observation data.},

  Abstract                 = {Hidden semi-Markov models are a generalization of the well-known hidden Markov model. They allow for a greater flexibility of sojourn time distributions, which implicitly follow a geometric distribution in the case of a hidden Markov chain. The aim of this paper is to describe hsmm, a new software package for the statistical computing environment R. This package allows for the simulation and maximum likelihood estimation of hidden semi-Markov models. The implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm assumes that the time spent in the last visited state is subject to right-censoring. It is therefore not subject to the common limitation that the last visited state terminates at the last observation. Additionally, hsmm permits the user to make inferences about the underlying state sequence via the Viterbi algorithm and smoothing probabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We present a statistical process control framework to support structural health monitoring of transportation infrastructure. We contribute an integrated, generally-applicable (to various types of structural response data) statistical approach that links the literatures on statistical performance modeling and on structural health monitoring. The framework consists of two parts: The first, estimation of statistical models to explain, predict, and control for common-cause variation in the data, i.e., changes, including serial dependence, that can be attributed to usual operating conditions. The ensuing standardized innovation series are analyzed in the second part of the framework, which consists of using Shewhart and Memory Control Charts to detect special-cause or unusual events. We apply the framework to analyze strain and displacement data from the monitoring system on the Hurley Bridge (Wisconsin Structure B-26-7). Data were collected from April 1, 2010 to June 29, 2011. Our analysis reveals that, after controlling for seasonal effects, linear trends are significant components of the response measurements. Persistent displacement may be an indication of deterioration of the bridge supports. Trends in the strain data may indicate changes in the material properties, i.e., fatigue, sensor calibration, or traffic loading. The results also show that autocorrelation and conditional heteroscedasticity are significant sources of common-cause variation. Use of the control charts detected 43 possible special-cause events, with approximately 50% displaying persisting effects, and 25% lasting longer than one week. Analysis of traffic data shows that unusually heavy loading is a possible cause of the longest special-cause event, which lasted 11&#xa0;days. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present two adaptive control formulations that explicitly include uncertainty in characterizing a facility's deterioration rate in the process of developing maintenance and repair policies. The formulations use condition information that stems from the operation of a facility to improve the characterization over a finite planning horizon. We discuss issues related to the implementation and computational complexity of the formulations. Through a computational study, we show that the economic benefits can be achieved by implementing the adaptive control formulations. These benefits are most significant in situations where the initial expected deterioration rate of the facility is not a good representation of its actual deterioration rate.},

The writer formulates the problem of developing maintenance and repair policies as a reinforcement learning problem in order to address this limitation. The writer explains the agency-facility interaction considered in reinforcement learning and discuss the probing-optimizing dichotomy that exists in the process of performing policy evaluation and policy selection. Then, temporal-difference learning methods are described as an approach that can be used to address maintenance and repair decision making. Finally, the results of a simulation study are presented where it is shown that the proposed approach can be used for decision making in situations where complete and correct deterioration models are not ~yet! available.},

  Abstract                 = {In Switzerland, it is common practice to estimate the total benefits of new roads before they have been built and of road <i>improvement interventions</i> before they have been performed. The guidelines with respect to standardised methodologies and models to be used have been developed (VSS 2003a) and are now in use. It is not yet, however, common practice to estimate the total benefits of road <i>preservation interventions</i> and hence guidelines do not exist with respect to standardised methodologies and models to be used. In order to provide this information, the research package VSS 2004/710-716 was started. This paper presents the methodology and models proposed to be used to evaluate the total benefits of road preservation interventions in Switzerland based on the evaluation and synthesis of existing national and international literature on the relationships between pavement condition and benefits of road use conducted in project 714 of the research package. The use of the methodology and models are demonstrated by determining the optimal intervention strategy for a representative situation in Switzerland. The impact on the optimal intervention strategy of the consideration of multiple stakeholders is investigated.},

As structures become older and maintenance costs become higher, different agencies and administrations in charge of civil infrastructure systems are facing challenges related to the implementation of structure maintenance and management systems based on life-cycle cost considerations. This article reviews the research to date related to probabilistic models for maintaining and optimizing the life-cycle performance of deteriorating structures and formulates future directions in this field.},

All other operation and maintenance measures have short run elasticities in the range 0.25-0.60. The impact of an additional vehicle is generally manifested in extra maintenance and operation costs, not only while the vehicle is using the road, but later on as well. Point estimates of long run cost elasticities are higher than one in general.},

  Abstract                 = {In Australian freight operations, maintenance costs comprise between 25 -35 percent of total train operating costs. Therefore, it is important that the track maintenance planning function is undertaken in an effective and efficient manner. This paper focuses on the development of a model designed to help resolve the conflicts between train operations and the scheduling of maintenance projects. The model involves scheduling maintenance projects to minimise disruptions to train services and reduce maintenance costs. The main applicability of such a model is as a decision support tool for track maintenance planners and train planners. The track maintenance scheduling problem, which involves the allocation of maintenance projects to time windows and crews to projects, is formulated as an integer programming model. The objective is to minimise a weighted combination of expected interference delays and prioritised finishing time. Minimising the first component will ensure a minimum interference between track maintenance projects and scheduled trains when either are delayed. The heuristic solution is obtained in two stages. Firstly, an initial solution is generated, scheduling each of the projects in turn, where the latter are ordered in terms of the relative importance of finishing time. Each project is selected and allocated to an available permissible work crew. If there are no available permissible work crews when the project is chosen, the earliest finishing crew will be selected. The second stage uses the tabu search heuristic. The model presented here was applied to an 89 km track corridor on the eastern coast of Australia. The schedule constructed using tabu search has a 7 percent reduction in objective function value as compared to the schedule constructed manually. The model was also used to demonstrate the effects of project schedule and maintenance resource changes. A four day planning horizon was used for which the model was used to test proposed changes. Increasing the time window by moving less important trains was shown to reduce potential delays significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {A successful pavement management system requires an accurate pavement performance prediction model. A novel pavement performance model using the piecewise approximation approach was developed to estimate the pavement serviceable life. It can be broadly applied to estimate pavement performance of any distress types or indexes. The basic theory of the piecewise approximation is to divide the whole pavement serviceable life into three zones: Zone 1 for early age pavement distress, Zone 2 in rehabilitation stage, and Zone 3 for overdistressed situations. Historical pavement performance data are regressed independently in each time zone. This approach can accurately predict pavement distress progression trends in each individual zone by eliminating possible impacts from biased data in other zones. This paper describes the theoretical piecewise approximation process of data classification and model regression and then demonstrates an implementation for a group of Washington State Department of Transportation asphalt concrete pavements. The results are compared with the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide incremental damage approach, the current Washington State Pavement Management System (WSPMS) exponential model, and ordinary regression on all data points. Results indicate that the proposed approach is able to estimate the most accurate rehabilitation due year and to predict the performance trends for each divided zone. The piecewise approximation approach is planned for implementation into the WSPMS and will play an important role in decision making for future pavement rehabilitations.},

  Abstract                 = {Four propositions drawn from 60 years of natural hazard and reconstruction research provide a comparative and historical perspective on the reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Decisions taken over its 288-year history that have made New Orleans so vulnerable to Katrina reflect a long-term pattern of societal response to hazard events—reducing consequences to relatively frequent events, and increasing vulnerability to very large and rare events. Thus Katrina's consequences for New Orleans were truly catastrophic—accounting for most of the estimated 1,570 deaths of Louisiana residents and $40–50 billion in monetary losses. A comparative sequence and timing of recovery provides a calendar of historical experience against which to gauge progress in reconstruction. Using this calendar, the emergency postdisaster period appears to be longer in duration than that of any other studied disaster. The restoration period, the time taken to restore urban services for the smaller population, is in keeping with or ahead of historical experience. The effort to reconstruct the physical environment and urban infrastructure is likely to take 8–11 years. Conflicting policy goals for reconstruction of rapid recovery, safety, betterment, and equity are already evident. Actions taken demonstrate the rush to rebuild the familiar in contrast to planning efforts that emphasize betterment. Because disasters tend to accelerate existing economic, social, and political trends, the large losses in housing, population, and employment after Katrina are likely to persist and, at best, only partly recover. However, the possibility of breaking free of this gloomy trajectory is feasible and has some historical precedent.},

  Abstract                 = {A probabilistic performance-based approach for generating a priority ranking of pavement rehabilitation project candidates is presented. The deployed probabilistic approach uses a discrete-time Markovian model to predict pavement conditions at the network level. The expected future distress rating associated with a particular pavement project is determined as the mean of a compound uniform probability density function derived from the corresponding future state probabilities. The expected future distress ratings for a particular pavement project are then used to construct the corresponding performance curve. The generated performance curves form the basis for developing an effective mechanism for prioritizing potential rehabilitation projects. A priority ranking system is presented with two alternatives. The first priority ranking alternative requires a fixed analysis period wherein project candidates are evaluated by using three different long-term performance indicators derived from the corresponding performance curves. The deployed performance indicators include the area under the performance curve, the average distress rating, and the terminal distress rating. The second priority ranking alternative requires a fixed terminal distress rating for the pavement network under consideration. The time required for each project to reach the terminal distress rating is determined as the rehabilitation scheduling time, which is used to establish project priority ranking. Pavement rehabilitation project candidates are then scheduled according to their priority rankings and available budget. The developed probabilistic approach is demonstrated by considering a project sample from the two-lane highway system in Ohio.},

  Abstract                 = {Decision makers are always faced with the challenge of selecting and implementing cost-effective pavement preservation alternatives, particularly when encountering shrinking budgets and increased competition for funds. Pavement intervention and investment evaluation criteria used in past research and practice are reviewed. The synthesis of pavement preservation effectiveness and efficiency evaluation techniques that is presented is unique from both benefit and cost perspectives. Criteria are of the following categories: effectiveness (benefit) only, cost only, cost-effectiveness, and economic efficiency. Computational details, past applications, merits, and demerits of various evaluation criteria are discussed for each criterion. Then selected criteria are computed with data from a national pavement study; they are used to evaluate alternative rigid pavement rehabilitation treatments. The case study results suggest that the superior short-term effectiveness exhibited by a treatment does not necessarily translate into superior long-term effectiveness. The evaluation results can vary widely for cost only, effectiveness only, and both cost and effectiveness criteria. Thus, evaluation based on cost-only or effectiveness-only criteria can yield biased evaluation results. To be a suitable candidate, a treatment or strategy must be not only effective but also cost-effective and economically efficient and the incorporation of user costs into evaluation can significantly influence the evaluation results. Such a synthesis can be a vital support for highway agencies in decision making for infrastructure management in general and pavement management in particular.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of motorway renewal costs presented in this paper was driven by two research questions: First, to analyse the economic process of motorway renewal work and to identify whether there exist economies of scale; and second to identify the influence of traffic volume on renewal costs and to derive an estimate of marginal infrastructure costs as part of optimal road user charges. The analysis is based on cross-sectional data for motorway renewal costs and traffic volume in Germany during the period 1980-1999. Two translog models were estimated, each of them including the factor input prices for labour, material and capital, and a set of regional dummy variables as well as dummy variables for the type of material used for renewal. The first model includes in addition to these variables the sqm of renewed road as explanatory variable. The second model was constructed to analyse the relationship between traffic volume and renewal costs and contains the average annual daily traffic volume of trucks and passenger cars as independent variables. Two main results were derived from the models: First, motorway renewal work is characterised by substantial economies of scale. Second, the relationship between renewal costs and traffic volume is expressed by a cost elasticity, i.e., the ratio between marginal and average costs, which ranges from 0.05 up to 1.17 with a digressive increase of marginal costs.},

  Abstract                 = {State-of-the-art decision-making models in the area of infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation (which are based on the Markov Decision Process) do not take into account the uncertainty in the measurement of facility condition. This paper presents a methodology, the Latent Markov Decision Process (LMDP), which explicitly recognizes the presence of random errors in the measurement of the condition of infrastructure facilities. Two versions of the LMDP are presented. In the first version, the inspection schedule is fixed, which is the usual assumption made in state-of-the-art models. The second version of the LMDP minimizes the sum of inspection and M & R costs. An empirical comparison of the two versions of the LMDP and the traditional MDP illustrates the importance of incorporating measurement uncertainty in decision-making and of optimizing the inspection schedule.},

  Abstract                 = {Rockfall barriers are optimized to absorb high punctual impact energies. In mountain areas the barriers are also loaded by avalanches and snow pressure. Snowpack forces and dynamic avalanche pressures act over a much larger area and over longer time periods. Thus, if not properly designed, rockfall barriers can be damaged. In winter 2003–2006 we investigated the interaction of flexible rockfall barriers with avalanches and snow pressure on a study site in Fieberbrunn, Austria and in other areas. In several locations the barriers successfully stopped small wet snow avalanches. However, the main problem turned out to be the insufficient retention capacity during the whole winter and the structural behaviour. The weakest points are the retaining ropes and the post foundations. For an appropriate design of the barrier the main input factors determining snow pressure and avalanche pressure have to be assessed. },

  Abstract                 = {With cities accounting for approximately two thirds of the global demand for energy, there is significant scope to optimize energy usage of cities, in particular by improving the use of the built form. Large non-domestic buildings are increasingly the focus of attention, due to their substantial demands and associated environmental impacts such as \{CO2\} emissions. Various approaches have been adopted to address building energy efficiency, with more recent studies relating consumption patterns to human occupancy. This paper proposes a new method to measure activity, using WiFi connections as a proxy for human occupancy. Data on the number of WiFi connections and energy consumption (electricity, steam and chilled water) were compared for two buildings within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's campus. The results of the study demonstrate: the operation of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems adhered more closely to factors other than occupancy i.e. external temperature, whilst a small part of the electricity levels did correlate with the occupancy. In order to present possible solutions to address the disconnect between the \{HVAC\} system and occupancy levels, this paper identifies future steps that could begin to improve energy usage. },

The transition probabilities were calculated from the observed changes in prevalence in the different classes of intensity for each STH species during the first year of intervention. The model was then developed and used to estimate the prevalence in year 2, 3, 4 and 5 for each STH species and for ‘any STH infection’. The prevalence predicted by the model was then compared with the prevalence observed at different times during programme implementation.Results The comparison between the model-predicted prevalence and the observed prevalence proved a good fit of the model.Conclusions We consider the Markov transition probability model to be a promising method of predicting changes in STH prevalence during control efforts. Further research to validate the model with observed data in different geographical and epidemiological settings is suggested to refine the prediction model.},

Unlike least-squares estimation which is primarily a descriptive tool, \{MLE\} is a preferred method of parameter estimation in statistics and is an indispensable tool for many statistical modeling techniques, in particular in non-linear modeling with non-normal data. The purpose of this paper is to provide a good conceptual explanation of the method with illustrative examples so the reader can have a grasp of some of the basic principles. },

  Abstract                 = {Vehicles on uncongested roads damage the pavement and advance the date at which repairs are necessary. Recent empirical work has identified another potentially more important social cost, for the damage to the pavement raises the operating costs of subsequent vehicles, and these operating costs may be an order of magnitude larger than the road maintenance costs. The paper develops a theory to handle this newly identified externality and establishes a remarkable result. If roads are repaired when they reach a predetermined critical condition (not necessarily optimally set) and if road damage is fully attributable to traffic, then in steady state with zero traffic growth the average road damage externality is zero, and the average marginal social cost of road use is equal to the average road maintenance cost. The result holds for arbitrary road damage and vehicle damage functions. Recent empirical studies reveal that weather accounts for a significant fraction of road deterioration, and in this case the road damage externality is no longer exactly zero, but is quantitatively negligible. The appropriate road user charge now only recovers the fraction of damage attributable to traffic.},

It extends previous researches in this area by solving the problem of multiple rehabilitation activities on multiple facilities, with realistic empirical models of deterioration and rehabilitation effectiveness. The formulation is based on discrete control theory. A nonlinear pavement performance model and integer decision variables are incorporated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). Two solution approaches, a branch-and-bound algorithm and a greedy heuristic, are proposed for this model. It is shown that the heuristic results provide a good approximation to the exact optima, but with much lower computational costs.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a general reward model for a non homogeneous semi-Markov system will be provided. Both discrete and continuous time models will be studied considering reward to be a random variable of the economic type associated with the state occupancies and transitions. Basic equations will be exhibited and the main formulas for the expected reward that the system will generate in some interval of time (with and without discounting) will be determined for the discrete and continuous cases and a method is provided in order to find it in closed analytic form in relation with the basic parameters of the system. Also, results will be obtained for the expected reward per time period for the steady state.},

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies can be used to simulate hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters from their posterior distribution given observed data. Some MCMC methods used in practice (for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states, and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I show how to use the recursive algorithms in an MCMC context and demonstrate mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler often used for HMMs. I introduce an augmented variables technique for obtaining unique state labels in HMMs and finite mixture models. I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient use of MCMC output when estimating the hidden states. I directly calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space size by MCMC, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently analyzed dataset in the HMM literature. The use of log-likelihood for assessing MCMC convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive checks are used to investigate application specific questions of model adequacy.},

  Abstract                 = {A computer-based bridge management system has been designed by the Finnish National Road Administration to assist in high-level bridge policy, long-term planning and programming of investments on the network level, and to help bridge engineers when preparing annual work programmes to reach targeted condition levels. The system applies probabilistic deterioration models to find a condition distribution of the bridges that minimises maintenance and rehabilitation costs for the existing bridge stock, and establishes deterministic repair and reconstruction indexes to organise individual bridges for annual programming.},

Additional contributions deal with testing the hypothesis that prior and sample information are compatible with each other; and with a scalar measure for the shares of these two kinds of information in the posterior precision.},

  Abstract                 = {The Pontis bridge management system is the predominant bridge management system employed in the United States. The system employs a network optimization model for preservation, formulated as a Markov decision process with a linear program solution procedure. On each bridge, a set of level-of-service standards determines functional needs, whose benefits are calculated according to a user cost model. A multi-year program simulation generates project alternatives by combining preservation and improvement needs on each bridge. The program is optimized within budget constraints by means of an incremental benefit/cost algorithm. The mathematical formulation of each of these components is presented and discussed. Aspects of system development and data management are outlined, along with the current implementation status. California's experience with the use of Pontis in its funding process is highlighted.},

The paper also discusses the research implications of missing data, types of missing data and concludes with recommendations on which techniques should be used under different circumstances in order to improve the treatment of missing data in \{OM\} survey research. },

  Abstract                 = {The problem of scheduling multiple feeds on parallel units is addressed. The performance of each unit is assumed to decrease with time, therefore requiringplanned maintenance to restore its performance. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model presented uses the process information regarding the exponential decay in performance with time to find a cyclic schedule for feed processing. Optimization trade-off is between the performance of the units, and the maintenance costs and the loss in production due to shutdowns. Three main decisions for the optimal schedule are: a) assignment of various feeds to different units; b) processing time of each feed on different units; and c) number of subcycles of each feed on diferent units. Special mathematical properties of the MINLP model are exploited to solve the problem to global optimality with a branch-and-bound method. Using several examples advantages of the model are illustrated and performances of different solution algorithms are compared.},

Two cases that are of particular interest to the railway industry are investigated. These are the failure of a sleeper system caused by at least two consecutive failed sleepers and by at least three consecutive failed ones, respectively. A model to optimize sleeper maintenance is proposed, which minimizes the number of sleepers restored during immediate maintenance subject to meeting the requirements of reliable and safe sleeper operation. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the model.},

A life-cycle cost model is developed to incorporate a track deterioration model and a tamping model. Based on the models, three optimal policies of ballast T&R are investigated, which include fixed intervention level, constant interval of tamping, and optimal nonconstant intervals of tamping. Three algorithms are presented to obtain the optimal solutions for the three policies. An example is presented to illustrate model performance. From a whole life point of view, eight options based on the three policies are compared for a better understanding of the effectiveness of the policies. The results show that considerable benefit could be achieved by considering ballast tamping and renewal together and implementing the optimal policy.},
