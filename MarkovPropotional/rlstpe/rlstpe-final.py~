    """ Load aggregate data from input file

    Aggregate data are loaded from a csv file. There by each column represents
    a condition state, each row a time step and each entry a sample
    proportion. Header and row names are not required.

    +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+
    |  Time |   S1  |   S2  | ... |   Sr  |
    +=======+=======+=======+=====+=======+
    |  t=0  | y1(0) | y2(0) | ... | yr(0) |

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : file or string
       File, or filename to read. Here, a file extension IS necessary!

    Returns
    -------
    data : numpy matrix
      Matrix where each row represents a condition states; i.e. data[0] = y1

    Examples
    --------
    >>> rlstpe.load_data('inp_test.csv') # doctest: +SKIP
    """
    # read data from csv file
    data = np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter=',')

    # return data in transposed format

def rlstpe(data):
    """Restricted least square transition probability estimator

    Calculates the restricted least square transition probability estimator
    based on the proposed model in [1]_. Thereby the objective function

    .. math::
       u^T u = (y-Xp)^T (y-Xp)

    is minimized subjected to the constrains

    .. math::
       Gp &= n\\
       p &\leq 0\\
       x_ij &= 0 if i>j

    where :math:`G` is an :math:`(r \times r^2)` known coefficient matrix
    :math:`[I_1,I_2,\dots I_r]` with each :math:`I_i` an :math:`(r \times r)`
    identity matrix and :math:`n` is an :math:`(r \times 1)` column vector
    with all entries equal one [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy matrix
      Matrix where each row represents a condition states; i.e. data[0] = y1

    Returns
    -------
    p the estimated transition probability : numpy matrix
      transition probability matrix p where :math:`p_{ij}` is the constant transition
      probability associated wit a change from state :math:`s_i` to :math:`s_j`.

    Note
    ----
    A change of the time period is at the moment not possible. Now the
    calculation goes form :math:`t=0` till :math:`t=T`, thereby :math:`t` is
    fixed by the initial data which are used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> rlstpe.rlstpe(data) # doctest: +SKIP
