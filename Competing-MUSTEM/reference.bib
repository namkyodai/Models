  abstract = {A supply and demand system approach is presented to deal with the
	inability of existing bridge management systems to determine optimal
	management strategies when multiple bridges may be adversely affected
	simultaneously. The supply and demand system approach alleviates
	this limitation because the optimization problem is formulated to
	minimize overall costs on the transportation network. The optimization
	problem is formulated focusing on the ability of the transportation
	network as a whole ~system! to provide an adequate level of service,
	taking into consideration the role and performance of the bridges
	in the network ~supply! and the consequences if an adequate level
	of service is not provided ~demand!. The supply and demand system
	approach is illustrated by determining the optimal management strategies
	for five bridges in a real transportation network subjected to two
	hazard scenarios: overloading due to traffic and scouring due to
	flooding. The main conclusion is that the supply and demand system
	approach is a rational approach to the development of optimal management
	strategies when bridges are adversely affected and may become nonoperational
	simultaneously.},

  abstract = {In Switzerland, it is common practice to estimate the total benefits
	of new roads before they have been built and of road <i>improvement
	interventions</i> before they have been performed. The guidelines
	with respect to standardised methodologies and models to be used
	have been developed (VSS 2003a) and are now in use. It is not yet,
	however, common practice to estimate the total benefits of road <i>preservation
	interventions</i> and hence guidelines do not exist with respect
	to standardised methodologies and models to be used. In order to
	provide this information, the research package VSS 2004/710-716 was
	started. This paper presents the methodology and models proposed
	to be used to evaluate the total benefits of road preservation interventions
	in Switzerland based on the evaluation and synthesis of existing
	national and international literature on the relationships between
	pavement condition and benefits of road use conducted in project
	714 of the research package. The use of the methodology and models
	are demonstrated by determining the optimal intervention strategy
	for a representative situation in Switzerland. The impact on the
	optimal intervention strategy of the consideration of multiple stakeholders
	is investigated.},

	Management Systems},
  journal = {Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research
	Board, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {1933},
  pages = {44-49},
  abstract = {Before an optimal bridge management strategy can be determined in
	existing bridge management systems, there must first be a determination
	of the type and schedule of interventions to be performed on each
	element of the bridge to achieve a minimal-cost long-term steady
	state. Once these element-level strategies are known, they are grouped
	together, or bundled, to develop a management strategy for the bridge.
	This is currently done with a set of agency rules without regard
	to whether the bundle of interventions is optimal. Interventions
	are bundled because it is not desirable to perform interventions
	on the same bridge in successive years, principally because of user
	costs. The work discussed here uses inventory theory to bundle interventions
	on bridges optimally with multiple elements. Two examples are presented.
	Example 1 shows how a basic joint replenishment model can be used
	on a multielement bridge to determine optimal management strategies
	when interventions are bundled and a single-stage policy is used.
	Example 2 shows how a joint replenishment model with quantity discounts
	can be used to alleviate some of the problems with a basic joint
	replenishment model. The optimal management strategy determined in
	Example 2 is compared with the optimal management strategy determined
	when interventions are not bundled. Direction for future work is
	given.},

	processes to select condition-based maintenance policies for the
	asset management of infrastructure systems. A key part of the method
	is using a Markov process to model the deterioration of condition.
	However, the Markov model assumes constant transition probabilities
	irrespective of how long an item has been in a state. The semi-Markov
	model relaxes this assumption. This paper describes how to fit a
	semi-Markov model to observed condition data and the results achieved
	on two data sets. Good results were obtained even where there was
	only 1 year of observation data.},

	Markov model. They allow for a greater flexibility of sojourn time
	distributions, which implicitly follow a geometric distribution in
	the case of a hidden Markov chain. The aim of this paper is to describe
	hsmm, a new software package for the statistical computing environment
	R. This package allows for the simulation and maximum likelihood
	estimation of hidden semi-Markov models. The implemented Expectation
	Maximization algorithm assumes that the time spent in the last visited
	state is subject to right-censoring. It is therefore not subject
	to the common limitation that the last visited state terminates at
	the last observation. Additionally, hsmm permits the user to make
	inferences about the underlying state sequence via the Viterbi algorithm
	and smoothing probabilities.},

	The formulations use condition information that stems from the operation
	of a facility to improve the characterization over a finite planning
	horizon. We discuss issues related to the implementation and computational
	complexity of the formulations. Through a computational study, we
	show that the economic benefits can be achieved by implementing the
	adaptive control formulations. These benefits are most significant
	in situations where the initial expected deterioration rate of the
	facility is not a good representation of its actual deterioration

	for infrastructure facilities, policy evaluation and policy
	
	selection are performed under the assumption that a perfect facility
	deterioration model is available. The writer formulates the problem
	of
	
	developing maintenance and repair policies as a reinforcement learning
	problem in order to address this limitation. The writer explains
	the
	
	agency-facility interaction considered in reinforcement learning and
	discuss the probing-optimizing dichotomy that exists in the process
	
	of performing policy evaluation and policy selection. Then, temporal-difference
	learning methods are described as an approach that can
	
	be used to address maintenance and repair decision making. Finally,
	the results of a simulation study are presented where it is shown
	that
	
	the proposed approach can be used for decision making in situations
	where complete and correct deterioration models are not ~yet!

  abstract = {A successful pavement management system requires an accurate pavement
	performance prediction model. A novel pavement performance model
	using the piecewise approximation approach was developed to estimate
	the pavement serviceable life. It can be broadly applied to estimate
	pavement performance of any distress types or indexes. The basic
	theory of the piecewise approximation is to divide the whole pavement
	serviceable life into three zones: Zone 1 for early age pavement
	distress, Zone 2 in rehabilitation stage, and Zone 3 for overdistressed
	situations. Historical pavement performance data are regressed independently
	in each time zone. This approach can accurately predict pavement
	distress progression trends in each individual zone by eliminating
	possible impacts from biased data in other zones. This paper describes
	the theoretical piecewise approximation process of data classification
	and model regression and then demonstrates an implementation for
	a group of Washington State Department of Transportation asphalt
	concrete pavements. The results are compared with the Mechanistic-Empirical
	Pavement Design Guide incremental damage approach, the current Washington
	State Pavement Management System (WSPMS) exponential model, and ordinary
	regression on all data points. Results indicate that the proposed
	approach is able to estimate the most accurate rehabilitation due
	year and to predict the performance trends for each divided zone.
	The piecewise approximation approach is planned for implementation
	into the WSPMS and will play an important role in decision making
	for future pavement rehabilitations.},

  abstract = {A probabilistic performance-based approach for generating a priority
	ranking of pavement rehabilitation project candidates is presented.
	The deployed probabilistic approach uses a discrete-time Markovian
	model to predict pavement conditions at the network level. The expected
	future distress rating associated with a particular pavement project
	is determined as the mean of a compound uniform probability density
	function derived from the corresponding future state probabilities.
	The expected future distress ratings for a particular pavement project
	are then used to construct the corresponding performance curve. The
	generated performance curves form the basis for developing an effective
	mechanism for prioritizing potential rehabilitation projects. A priority
	ranking system is presented with two alternatives. The first priority
	ranking alternative requires a fixed analysis period wherein project
	candidates are evaluated by using three different long-term performance
	indicators derived from the corresponding performance curves. The
	deployed performance indicators include the area under the performance
	curve, the average distress rating, and the terminal distress rating.
	The second priority ranking alternative requires a fixed terminal
	distress rating for the pavement network under consideration. The
	time required for each project to reach the terminal distress rating
	is determined as the rehabilitation scheduling time, which is used
	to establish project priority ranking. Pavement rehabilitation project
	candidates are then scheduled according to their priority rankings
	and available budget. The developed probabilistic approach is demonstrated
	by considering a project sample from the two-lane highway system
	in Ohio.},

  abstract = {The analysis of motorway renewal costs presented in this paper was
	driven by two research questions: First, to analyse the economic
	process of motorway renewal work and to identify whether there exist
	economies of scale; and second to identify the influence of traffic
	volume on renewal costs and to derive an estimate of marginal infrastructure
	costs as part of optimal road user charges. The analysis is based
	on cross-sectional data for motorway renewal costs and traffic volume
	in Germany during the period 1980-1999. Two translog models were
	estimated, each of them including the factor input prices for labour,
	material and capital, and a set of regional dummy variables as well
	as dummy variables for the type of material used for renewal. The
	first model includes in addition to these variables the sqm of renewed
	road as explanatory variable. The second model was constructed to
	analyse the relationship between traffic volume and renewal costs
	and contains the average annual daily traffic volume of trucks and
	passenger cars as independent variables. Two main results were derived
	from the models: First, motorway renewal work is characterised by
	substantial economies of scale. Second, the relationship between
	renewal costs and traffic volume is expressed by a cost elasticity,
	i.e., the ratio between marginal and average costs, which ranges
	from 0.05 up to 1.17 with a digressive increase of marginal costs.},

	Process) do not take into account the uncertainty in the measurement
	of facility condition. This paper presents a methodology, the Latent
	Markov Decision Process (LMDP), which explicitly recognizes the presence
	of random errors in the measurement of the condition of infrastructure
	facilities. Two versions of the LMDP are presented. In the first
	version, the inspection schedule is fixed, which is the usual assumption
	made in state-of-the-art models. The second version of the LMDP minimizes
	the sum of inspection and M & R costs. An empirical comparison of
	the two versions of the LMDP and the traditional MDP illustrates
	the importance of incorporating measurement uncertainty in decision-making
	and of optimizing the inspection schedule.},

	If roads are repaired when they reach a predetermined critical condition
	(not necessarily optimally set) and if road damage is fully attributable

	road damage externality is zero, and the average marginal social
	cost of road use is equal to the average road maintenance cost. The
	result holds for arbitrary road damage and vehicle damage functions.
	Recent empirical studies reveal that weather accounts for a significant

	a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions

	often used for HMMs. I introduce an augmented variables technique
	for obtaining unique state labels in HMMs and finite mixture models.
	I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient
	use of MCMC output when estimating the hidden states. I directly
	calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space
	size by MCMC, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian
	information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently
	analyzed dataset in the HMM literature. The use of log-likelihood
	for assessing MCMC convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive
	checks are used to investigate application specific questions of
	model adequacy.},

	The performance of each unit is assumed to decrease with time, therefore
	requiringplanned maintenance to restore its performance. A mixed-integer
	nonlinear programming (MINLP) model presented uses the process information
	regarding the exponential decay in performance with time to find
	a cyclic schedule for feed processing. Optimization trade-off is
	between the performance of the units, and the maintenance costs and
	the loss in production due to shutdowns. Three main decisions for
	the optimal schedule are: a) assignment of various feeds to different
	units; b) processing time of each feed on different units; and c)
