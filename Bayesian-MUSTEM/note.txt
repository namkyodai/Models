I - Instruction on using subroutine from Fortran
setwd("C:/Users/namazu/Documents/Markovmodelwith-R/")
1. gauss.dll is converted from gauss.f for calculating invert matrix A
2. invertmatrix.dll is converted from invertmatrix.f for calculating invertmatix

Calling dll file into R shared library 
dyn.load("gauss.dll")
#dyn.load("invertmatrix.dll") this is still have internal problem when converting to dll library.


II-Supporting R program

1. markovgiventheta.R
This program shows a basic calculationg of Markov transition probability given values of theta.
